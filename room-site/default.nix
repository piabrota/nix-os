# The room (piabrota/room): a 3D room in Vite and three.js, built once on the builder with
# `npm ci` and `vite build` from a pinned commit. The output is dist/ and nothing else:
# allowedReferences = [ ] fails the build if it names a store path, so node and the npm
# packages never reach the VPS closure. A new commit of piabrota/room shows on the site only
# after a PR here changes rev, hash and npmDepsHash.
