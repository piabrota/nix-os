# marola-site (marola-dev/marola-site) at a pinned commit, built by that repository's own
# nix/package.nix: the Haskell server (bin/marola-server) and the site it serves
# (share/marola/dist: the Elm map page and the static pages). The package is theirs; nothing here
# copies its code. To move the pin: change rev and hash together (`nix hash path` on
# `git archive <rev>`). passthru carries what the board build and the tiles unit read from the same commit: the
# app image it pins (marola-image), site/areas.json, the base map pin and its extract script.
